    "subtitle": "Starting I knew it was going to happen lol, my first month in I had someone record a clip of me giving head (to a dildo LMAO) or doing lil titty flashes, one of them was from my banned TT acc that they posted literally a year later?? \n\nThis time however, after a year of camming..my full stream start to finish..an almost 3hr stream was leaked. I was able to get it taken down after 2k ppl downloaded it😭 what’s funny tho is that stream was really bad, I had no buzz trains and it was just super dead that day. Which is funny bc some ppl in the comments were like “thanks I can never catch her streams” BUT THAT WAS MY WORST ONE muahahah gotta come back for the good shows bby &lt;33\n\n (idk if I’m lucky, but it’s always the bad stuff they decide to record too, like why record me suckin a dildo when I’ll be fuckin it next show? Like tf lmao) \n\nBut yeah I dunno, I was able to get it taken down w out DMCA(?) just by reporting the vid luckily. I don’t know how many more recordings of me are out there but I’d like to hope that’s the only one, although I assume if there’s 1 leak there’s prob 10 more floating around somewhere lol",

I totally get your hesitation — giving your real name for DMCA takedowns *feels* scary at first, but it’s actually normal and legally required since you're asserting ownership over the content. I’ve done it myself through services like **Rulta** (they handle it on your behalf, so your name isn't exposed to the sites directly), and I’ve also filed a few manually when I had to.\n\nWith sites like the ones you linked, yes, it’s possible to get stuff removed, *but* be aware:\n\n1. You’re likely submitting your info to a blackhole and hoping they honor the DMCA\n2. Some shady sites ignore takedowns unless they’re followed up legally\n\nIf you're nervous about privacy, I highly recommend using a **DMCA agency or third party** like Rulta. They include the legal info on your behalf and shield your real name from being publicly visible. It worked for me, especially with Recurbate, which I thought was impossible.\n\nSo yes — it *can* work, and yes, it’s safe if done properly.

Also, some sites will comply faster than others, especially if they’re based outside the US. Just keep documenting what you submit and follow up when needed.",
