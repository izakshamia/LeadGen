I’m in urgent need of legal advice or a lawyer who specializes in copyright infringement, IP protection, and contract enforcement.\n\nHere’s the situation:\n\t•\tFrom December 2024 to July 2025, I worked for a wellness brand as their creative lead — designing everything from brand guides, website layouts, Amazon A+ content, videos, product photography, social/email campaigns, and more.\n\t•\tDespite multiple requests, the client never signed a scope of work or formal contract. I delivered everything in good faith.\n\t•\tI was paid at a reduced rate ($5K/month vs. my original $8K quote), and ultimately asked to sign a retroactive contract assigning ownership of all work — which I refused.\n\t•\tThe client terminated our relationship immediately after I declined to sign, but they are still actively using all of my work on:\n\t•\tTheir Amazon storefront (product images, A+ content, videos)\n\t•\tShopify website (banners, layout, copy)\n\t•\tEmail marketing (Klaviyo)\n\t•\tSocial media and printed mailers\n\nThe kicker? All of my original work is published, and most of it is within the 3-month window, meaning I’m eligible for statutory damages if I register now. Much of what they’re using is a derivative or unedited version of my original designs — with no license granted.\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 What I need:\n\t•\tHelp registering Visual Arts, Motion Picture, and Literary Works\n\t•\tGuidance on revoking any implied license\n\t•\tA cease &amp; desist letter and DMCA takedowns (Amazon, Shopify)\n\t•\tHelp calculating retroactive licensing fees + business damages\n\t•\tPossibly litigation or settlement negotiations\n\n⸻\n\n📂 I have everything documented — timestamps, screenshots, delivery emails, export logs, etc. I just need help taking action quickly and correctly.\n\nIf you’re an IP/copyright attorney or know someone who specializes in creative freelancer protection, I’d really appreciate your insight or referral 🙏\n\nLocation: Chicago IL\n",

I created everything myself using BandLab (and other daws I showed them too) original vocals, lyrics, and (some) beats that are free for profit and cleared for commercial use\n\nI contacted the claimant directly but they never responded Their email is tied to a broken Squarespace site and there’s no real proof they’re a legitimate lawyer or rights holder \n\nI submitted a valid DMCA counter notification to my distributor (Too Lost) in early June. It included everything required under the law name, address, statement under penalty of perjury, signature, and consent to court jurisdiction. It’s been over 14 business days since they received it. No lawsuit has been filed by the claimant, and I’ve heard nothing back from Too Lost. They keep saying the DSPs (Spotify, Apple, etc.) are responsible, but I was under the impression that the distributor is legally required to forward the counter notice and restore the content if no legal action is taken within the 10 to 14 business day window.\n\nMy question   is this a violation of 17 U.S.C. § 512(g) on Too Lost’s part? Can I file complaints with the FTC or U.S. Copyright Office anonymously (or at least without giving Too Lost more of my personal info)? What legal options do I realistically have to force them to comply and or put some pressure so they can release my earnings?\n\nThis situation is seriously affecting my creative flow and mental health to an extent sorta just been draining frustrating and I feel stuck. I just want my content restored like the law says\n\nAny help or guidance would be appreciated ALOT ",

    "title": "Fanfiction &amp; DMCA (US Copyright Law)",
    "subtitle": "Location: California, United States\n\nMy understanding, per [Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-1292.ZO.html) and [related case law](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Legal\\_Analysis) is that fanfiction is often considered fair use. Courts consider the balance that a work is (1) noncommercial and not sold for a profit, (2) transformative, adding new meaning and messages to the original, (3) limited, not copying the entirety of the original, or (4) not a substitute for the original work (taken [from this FAQ](https://www.transformativeworks.org/faq/)). None of these attributes are independently considered necessary or sufficient, so it takes a court to balance it out on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn practice, this means not selling fanfiction, because the fight against Disney lawyers (or whomever) is not worth it. \n\nThis does bring up the question of what happens when fanfiction - which, by and large, it seems authors do retain copyright of - is wholesale copied in itself. Fanfiction authors often publish pseudoanonymously. It is especially common for closeted LGBT authors to write LGBT fanfic, and therefore attaching their legal name to their fanfiction can be a problem to those in hostile households.\n\nOccasionally, people will wholesale copy other fanfic authors' works and post them on other sites as their own works (plagiarism). If authors retain the copyright to their own transformative works as outlined above, this poses a copyright violation. However, authors are often reluctant to file DMCA notices, as giving a random person on the internet your legal name and address can pose personal risk.\n\n**My question is: can one sign one's pseudonym as one's legal name?** The forms state that legal name is required. However, it seems that [copyright can be under a pseudonym](https://copyrightalliance.org/faqs/can-you-register-copyright-under-pseudonym/), and it stands to reason that the DMCA can be under a pseudonym as well - is this correct? (Obviously putting one's own address can still pose a problem, but that may be solvable with a PO box.)\n\n\n\nThank you.",

I’m trying to figure out:\n\n* Can I fight this based on being abroad with verifiable proof?\n* Would providing I-94 travel history potentially get the claim dropped?\n* Should I still hire a lawyer even though I have a strong alibi?\n* Is there any risk they’ll pursue me anyway just because the IP address matches?\n\nIf anyone has gone through something similar — especially with DMCA subpoena or ISP disclosure situations — I’d really appreciate any advice. I want to handle this the right way but avoid overreacting.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "subtitle": "Location: Ontario\n\nBackground:\n* My mom immigrated to Toronto over 30 years ago and started a successful business.\n* My dad married her, they ran it together, and later he took over while she stayed home to raise us.\n* In 2014, her father died, and she went back home to Africa for nearly a set year to settle affairs (she's the eldest of 20 siblings). My dad encouraged her to go and gave her his full support.\n* While she was away, he sold their business for $1.4 million and their home for $660k. He told her he bought a house mortgage-free in a small town in Ontario so we could live interest-free (we’re Muslim).\n* She returned to find the house was much smaller and in poor condition, but let it go.\nWhat Went Wrong:\n* In 2014, they \"bought\" a new house worth $255k. He claimed it was paid in cash and both their names were on it.\n* In 2019, my dad secretly married another woman abroad and had kids with her. He left our home and doesn’t live with us anymore.\n* In 2022, we found out that my mom's name was removed from the title of the house in January 2021, even though she was in Edmonton from Dec 2020 to March 2021 (we have proof of her travel).\n* He used an imposter to pose as my mom and sign title transfer papers, removing her from ownership. The lawyer admitted (on recording) that they accepted the ID after the meeting via WhatsApp.\n* He then took out a $260k mortgage on the house (original mortgage was $130k), paid that off, paid $18k of his own credit card debt (in my mom’s name), and sent me $20k randomly to invest in a business for my aunt.\n* He kept about $90k and disappeared.\n\nHow We Got Stuck:\n* We found out a year later, after he stopped paying the mortgage, and the lender said they'd foreclose unless we paid it all off.\n* My mom had no income or credit. So in 2023, my sister and I (both working/students) were pressured to take out a $310k private loan with high interest just to save the house.\n* At the last minute, my dad refused to transfer the house fully to us unless he got 50% ownership, even though he doesn’t live here and doesn’t pay anything.\n* We’ve been paying $2800/month since, while juggling jobs, school, and financial strain.\n* The house has mold, leaking, and broken doors/windows. At best, it might sell for $400k as-is.\nLegal Situation:\n* We went to the police in 2022. They told us it was a civil matter and we needed to get a lawyer. We filed a report but haven’t heard back.\n* Our lawyer at the time said we should pursue this through family law, not civil fraud, since it was \"hard to prove fraud.\"\n* We have evidence:\n    * Fake signature vs real one\n    * Travel proof showing my mom wasn’t in the province when the title was signed\n    * A recorded conversation with the lawyer admitting they didn’t verify ID properly\n\n❓My Questions:\n1. Can we still go to the police and push for criminal charges (fraud, impersonation, forgery)?\n2. Can we sue my dad through family court and get my mom’s share of the house back?\n3. If we sell the house now, will he get 50% even though we paid everything since 2023?\n4. Would it help to report the lawyer to the Law Society of Ontario for negligence?\n5. What are our best legal options right now to stop bleeding money into this mess?\n\nAny help, advice, or direction would mean the world. We're just trying to protect our mom and not go under financially.\nThank you for reading",

We have a bedroom that needs to be completely gutted because of water damage, all drywall, as well as insulation. \n\nWe were able to get ahold of the original contractor who came and tried to seal the leak with roofing caulk, and it didn't work, and eventually a week ago, he wound up having the half that leaks completely redone with a different roofing group. Turned out the first time there was no paper or ice and rain barrier laid down.\n\nAfter the roof was torn off and redone, a couple days later we got a heavy rain storm, and it turns out the roof still leaks. Its been about a week since the new roof was completed and the contractor was informed of the continued leak and we haven't heard back from him aside from him saying \"dammit\" on Sunday. \n\nAt this point I'm not sure if I'm supposed to let him attempt to get it repaired again, or if have any legal grounds to go after the seller, or the contractor to have the roof redone again by a different company altogether, plus needing to have the one bedroom redone. We're approaching the 5th month of this issue.\n\nI'm kind of tired of not being able to utilize one of my bedrooms, my insurance won't help me and basically told us to kick rocks, as I discovered the leak within like 4 days of closing and the policy start date, and they basically told me to talk to the seller. I'm a bit cash broke and cannot financially afford this repair at this time as I bought the house for cash with a small inheritance from a recently deceased family member, and most of the rest of the money went towards moving and furnishing and towards my kids. \n\nI'm not sure who I go after, as the contractor was not contracted by myself, but by the seller, the original roofer skipped town, and now a different roofer has touched it. I would appreciate any advice possible, I have the money to sue, but I dont have the roughly 20k to have the roof and the bedroom redone, and the contractor didn't actually even offer to repair the bedroom at all, however he did offer to drop off drywall to do the work ourselves, which I'm okay with as I've done drywall work plenty during my life.

I reported all these issues with pictures and documentation.

My husband and I moved out of the apartment in March after it basically felt unlivable and unsafe (I was worried about mold exposure and if there was a fire, we had nothing to put it out with). They did not let us break our lease and stated we had to finish out our contract or pay a fee. \n\nIn May, they reached out to “fix” the issues and I informed them that we were using the apartment as a storage unit due to the unlivable conditions. \n\nOur lease just ended and they sent me a signed, official final statement letter saying they owed me my deposit + extra money. I thought the extra money was to compensate for the work they never performed on the apartment which caused us to move out early. \n\nThey just called me today (2 weeks after I got the check and deposited it) saying it was a mistake and they want me to pay them back. They stated they accidentally put the new tenants funds into my account before closing my account. Is there any merit to this? Do I have to return the funds if I have legal, signed documentation saying they owed me a certain amount and I accepted it in good faith?",

    "title": "Water leak leads to damage caused by water restoration company estimator (NJ, USA)",
    "subtitle": "Location: NJ, USA\n\nI had a water leak in my house that originated from a cracked supply line underneath my upstairs master bathroom sink. It's unclear exactly how long it had been leaking, although I first noticed it when the water began dripping/dribbling down my office wall on the 1st floor (which is mostly underneath the upstairs master bathroom). I don't think it could have been going on that long based on the rate of water I saw leaking out of the supply line when I discovered the source of the leak. \n\nI turned off the water to my house to stop the leak, and had a plumber out the next day to repair the supply line. He advised that he could give me info for a water remediation/restoration company, but instead took it upon himself to contact them (or his office did) and they showed up relatively unannounced. \n\nI did invite the \"project manager\" / salesman / estimator from the water remediation company in, but figured it would my a semi quick process for him to review everything and advise next steps or provide an estimate. I even told him I didn't have that much time.  \n\nInstead, without my consent, he proceeded to partially pull up carpets upstairs (I shouldn't have left him alone but I had no idea his estimate process involved destructive actions), and poke a bunch of small pinholes in my walls and ceilings downstairs - which I couldn't even tell he was doing (I was with him downstairs but it wasn't clear that the device he was using was creating these pinholes). He certainly didn't ask my permission to do any of this, or announce he was going to do it beforehand. \n\nI don't even know all the places be created these pinholes since I wasn't watching him every second he was \"putting together his estimate\". I'm pretty positive that the leak was not very bad (although I'm waiting for a contractor to come and confirm), but now I have to repair all the damage this \"project manager\" made as well (the contractor will have to do that also).  \n\nWhen I declined to proceed with service from the water remediation company right then and there (he was trying to sell it hard), he wouldn't even leave me an estimate. He just kept trying to convince me to put everything through my homeowners insurance and sign so they could start the remediation work. The fact that he wouldn't leave me an estimate seemed very shady and sketchy. \n\nAnd then, after I thought he'd left, he came into my backyard unannounced and then back into my house. I wasn't absolutely certain at that point that I didn't want to use them (I was having a bad day with the leak) so I let him proceed, but I really should have just kicked him out at that point. \n\nSo, long story short (I know...too late), I now have to deal with the repairs that this \"project manager\" caused as well as getting any leak damage fixed (if there is any). Since I never gave permission for this \"project manager\" to take these destructive actions during the course of his visit, do I have any recourse? Can I demand the company reimburse me for the damage he caused? Could I sue in small claims if it came to that? Or am I out of luck because I let him in my house? \n\nThanks!",

    "subtitle": "Location: NYC \n\nHi! So just like the title reads, my roommate is threatening to take me to small claims court because I told her to set a fairer price for her room. Right now, I pay almost 60% of the rent and have furnished the apartment fully. Things went badly when I paid to have drywall removed out of the common area and told her the price and that she could pay me anything towards it. She paid me $0. I also started going away for prolonged periods of time and coming back to the apartment pretty gross. Some recent examples include the drain in the shower being so backed up water filled the tub, a really bad faucet leak, mold all over the bathroom, a dishwasher packed to the brim and left, etc. \n\nToday, I texted her telling her that I planned to leave in November. She texted me back saying she was out come September. She said some other mildly threatening things in the texts, they aren’t relevant, but I have receipts of literally everything that she’s ever said to me over text, I’ve ever said, and documented the gross state of the apartment when I’ve left and come back. She claims that the cat litter box is dosgusting and my cat is living in poor conditions- that’s about the extent of her complaints about me. The cat litter box is a $500 automatic one that cleans itself, my cat has been at my parents the majority of the summer and the litter box hasn’t been filled, and I’ve asked every single person who’s ever come into the apartment if it smells like litter and they all say no. If you can’t tell, I keep spaces pretty immaculate and I’m pretty sensitive to smelly litter… \n\nI also pay 60% of the rent and though my room is bigger and has windows, I am 1000% overpaying. I have texts repetitively asking her to pay more and that I would help her out when needed. It wasn’t until we signed the lease that she came to me and said she could only pay a little bit more, on the very low end of the range I requested that would be fair, and as shown in the texts i have I told her that I’d help her out. Clearly, I no longer want to. And with her moving out, I told her to list the room for a fair price and that come September I wouldn’t be helping her out anymore. She’s threatening small claims court and I an confused because she told me she’s leaving September and I don’t know why it would matter to her if her room rent is raised, she won’t be here? Unless she’s bluffing and isn’t planning to leave? I’m honestly so confused\n\nOn top of all this and just for a little bit more context, my landlord doesn’t like her. He didn’t even want to sign her on the new lease because she had sent him a scathing email about mold in the bathroom (I now realize it’s because she doesn’t clean anything) and skipped out on paying a security deposit for months after she moved in because she thought she was entitled to it or something along those lines? \n\nI think she’s just bluffing on a lot of things and I’m not sure if small claims court will happen, but I want to be prepared if it does. She’s caused me to not only inadvertently take financial losses since her staying on the lease but my mental health is hanging on by a literal thread. I just need somewhat of a comfort knowing I’ll be alright legally if this blows up which I really hope it doesn’t and she just leaves come September like she says she is. ",

    "subtitle": "Location: California, USA\n\nHi Reddit. First time ever seeking legal advice. I am a content creator who does a variety of short-form video content for both myself and brands. Recently, I dipped into user-generated content (UGC) via this TikTok One initiative hosted on TikTok. How the program works is you essentially join campaigns created by brands on TikTok One, submit content that follows their brief and then they run that content as an ad exclusively on TikTok. The content is not supposed to leave TikTok as you get a revenue share of that ad spend.\n\n  \nRecently, I discovered that a brand had taken the video I made for them off-platform and was running it as ads on Facebook/Instagram. I contacted them with a script recommended by some of my fellow creators asking for a takedown of the ads and to pay me for my lost earnings. They responded with a contract that I need to sign before they'll pay my invoice, but the contract looks suspicious. The verbiage is very clear that they are not assuming any responsibility for my stolen content or accepting any blame (basically, everything I've claimed is \"alleged\" and this is purely a settlement, despite sending evidence of the ads being run) and that I wouldn't be able to try anything against them in the future if we had any other problems. I asked for them to add a section clarifying that my content would not be run as an ad in the future, as my main worry with the verbiage is that I'm going to sign the dotted line and they're going to continue exploiting my content since I'm not allowed to bring any grievances up again, and I was essentially ignored.\n\n  \nI'd like to ask them to please include this section before I get my lawyers involved... but I don't have a lawyer and am afraid they'll call my bluff. I don't know anything about lawyer services, fees, etc. and this is all over a $1,000 payment. Should I just sign the contract? Is it worth finding a lawyer somewhere and paying their fees? ANY knowledge in this department is very appreciated!",

After he admitted that he hid some information on our date and after me finding more discrepancies and other concerning information via some internet research, I did not want to continue pursuing him. I blocked his number and he immediately texts me from a different number - his work cell phone number. I tell him clearly “I have to ask you to not contact me anymore. I am no longer interested” and block the second number. Once I check my iMessages on my laptop I realized that he messages me (these exact words) “I’ll find you” from one and “I’ll hurt you” from the other. \n\nObviously I’m terrified. But, I don’t know what to do. I’m scared of pursuing legal options because I don’t want to instigate him and cause him to get violent. A TRO is just a piece of paper after all… if he wants to stalk me and hurt me then I don’t think that will change anything. Plus, he’s a family law attorney and presumably uses Lexis people search to find parties to serve them. I already submitted a takedown request with Lexis (that info is unfortunately up to date) and it’ll take up to 30 days to remove. \n\nDo I file a bar complaint because he threatened an attorney with violence (which is a crime)? It doesn’t seem worth it when I have to provide evidence of what happened and he’d obviously see the screenshots and know it’s me. Further, I have little faith that the CA bar will do anything about this given it wasn’t behavior exhibited during the scope of a representative matter.\n\nDo I try to get a TRO and open myself to potential exposure? I’m worried that may make him retaliate violently.\n\nDo I do nothing and hope it boils over? He could just be a guy with a bruised ego. But I’m scared to be a sitting duck.\n\nDo I invest in some self defense equipment..? I just don’t know what to do. Any advice on a potential safe remedy is appreciated.",

    "subtitle": "LOCATION: NY USA\n\nHello,\n\nI'm hoping to get some perspective and potentially some advice on a situation I encountered while trying to sell a used CPU on eBay. I listed a used CPU + combined for other parts for sale. It was a genuine processor manufactured by AMD, specifically one from their Ryzen line. In my eBay listing title and description, I used the words \"AMD\" and \"Ryzen\" to accurately describe the item being sold (e.g., \"Used AMD Ryzen 5 5600X CPU\") 2 days later,  eBay removed my listing. I received a notification stating it was reported by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) via the Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) program for violating their intellectual property rights. The specific claim seems to be trademark infringement because I used the terms \"AMD\" and \"Ryzen\". The eBay notification mentioned potential legal consequences threatened by AMD.\n\nI'm quite confused and a bit concerned by this. I was selling a single, genuine, used product that I legally own. It seems necessary to use the manufacturer's name (\"AMD\") and the product line (\"Ryzen\") to identify what the item actually is so potential buyers know what they are looking at. I wasn't trying to pass myself off as AMD or an authorized dealer, nor was I selling counterfeit goods. Did I actually violate any law? This seems like a ridiculous thing someone can do by claiming trademark. I can't specify the product I'm selling or post pictures I took just because two words that they \"own\" are in it?",

We are in the same space so yes, there is going to be overlap with verbiage and language used. I took a look at her website and the only major similarities I see is we both have the word \"rooted\" in our business name and a similar color green for one of the branding colors. Otherwise, they are very different. Even the content has a very different feel to it, IMO. I'm very niche on hormone health and fertility, she's very generic in the functional nutrition space. I looked at a few of her posts and there were maybe 2 that stood out as similar, ironically I actually posted them about a week before she did.. \n\nAnyway I wrote her back acknowledging her comments and reassuring her that nothing I've posted was copied in any way (because truly it hasn't). I also come from 8 years of coporate and start up marketing, I was a content marketing manager along with playing various other marketing roles before I made my side gig my main business. So I'm not new to the marketing world and truly would never steal anyone's branding or content ideas. \n\nShe came back to me saying she basically doesn't believe me (which fine, I don't really care) and that at this time she won't be pursuing legal action but may in the future \"if I continue to copy her branding and content\".  I didn't respond, I have no interest in talking to someone who seems delulu and has nothing better to do.\n\n  \nNow I'm not familiar with the laws around copyright infringement, however to me if she did decide to take legal action (by all means she can), she doesn't really have much to stand on. Nothing is copied on my end nor do I tend to (the way she writes is very kiddish it to me and too many emjios). But I'm curious on others thoughts who have more experience here. If she did proceed forward, what may happen? Ive document our conversation and any posts that someone may have thought was similar. \n\nAlso will note because I've been in the marketing space for nearly a decade, I can tell so easily that even in her communications with me, the content she posts, and her website was all written with AI.

    "subtitle": "I knows its been discussed before but it seems like some of the posts are out of date and otherwise scattered. I thought it might be helpful to have a thread to compile any new information people had on removal from the cbrecorder network of sites, which have seemed to be a recurring tough nut to crack.\n\nPaths:\n\n\\## Removal Serivices \n\nNot that it matters legally but I did note that most of these sites contain some form of the language:\"WE accept DMCA requests only from models. Requests submitted by agents, fans, or any third parties will be rejected.\"\n\nThis is probably in part a scare tactic. Searching on lumendatabase org I can find many search removal requests involving these sites, but the ones I followed up did not seem to lead to actual content removal\n\n\\## Direct Email/Form Complaints\n\nThe consensus seems to be that submissions through any of these sites webforms are futile. But I wanted to check if any one had success, and if so what the strategy was. And additionally if anyone was able to track down specific emails that received responses. The only actual email I could find on any of the site was dmca@ webcamfucker com\n\n\\## Hosting/Cloudflare\n\nI know at least in the past the consensus was these sites were all hosted by AlexHost SRL. But Some users indicated that the sides moved to Shinjiru 9 months ago. So wanted to see ifanyone had a good idea of the current hosting situation.\n\nIn the past it has seemed like going through CloudFlares abuse form (abuse . cloudflare com/dmca) sometimes yielded better results for other sites, and I wanted to check on peoples experiences for these specific sites. Also most of domain names are namecheap registered, has anyone tried their complaint form?\n\n\\## Moldovan Police\n\nI know in previous threads a few people had discussed going down the path. And wanted to see if there were any updates on whether it was successful and what was involved\n\nAs far as I can tell cbrecorder and/or mychaturcam are the main sites, since for many of the other DMCA pages redirect to one of the two.\n\nI know Im in the same frustrating situation as many others, and am just trying to get as much info as possible as I plan mt attempts\n\nAlso If anyone knows of other sites in this network it would also be helpful to keep a running list.\n\n* cbrecorder com\n* webcamrecs com\n* manyrecs com\n* webcamfucker com\n* chaturwebcamrecs com\n* showmyrecs com\n* fuckchaturgirls com\n* cbcamsclub com\n* joinsexcams com\n* camreclub com\n* cbcatalog com\n* freecinemaclub com\n* mychaturcam com\n* recordercb com",

    "subtitle": "Recently there was a post here asking how to deal with leaks. Reading through the many, many replies on that post, I was extremely shocked by the entirely unanimous response being to shrug it off, never ever think about it, or even to consider it \"free advertising.\" 🤮  \n\nI wanted to create my own post to share my point of view for further discussion, as I did not realize how contrary my thoughts on this topic seem to be to the majority of this community. Here are my thoughts:\n\n***Not enough of you seem to take leaks seriously or consider them a breach of your privacy as well as a threat to your business.*** No, leaks are not \"free advertising\" - if someone is searching out of their way for your leaked content they already know who you are AND have zero reason to pay you for your work because you're doing nothing to minimize the amount of your work that can be found elsewhere for free. There are places it is beneficial for you to be advertised, however the demographic of leak sites is NOT the demographic you want to be advertising to. It's like going into a shoplifting forum and promoting your store. Think about it, how does that really benefit you? \n\nYes leaks are inevitable, yes there are certain kinds of customers who are going to find your leaked content no matter what you do. However, there are genuinely so many actions you can easily take to make it more inconvenient for people to find your leaked content, therefore creating a situation where if someone wants to see something from you they will HAVE to pay for it. Many of these sites ARE dmca compliant and will remove content if you contact them with a valid request. You should know which sites are possible to remove from and check up on those regularly, getting content taken down ASAP when possible to do so is very important for preventing further distribution to more takedown-resilient hosts. And if a site doesn't comply with DMCA, at least send a Google request and make sure people can't just easily find things on Google. \n\nIt's like owning a bike shop and having bikes sitting out front on display. Do you want to have a lock on those bikes or not? OF COURSE YOU DO. At a bare minimum, you should be submitting links to Google (which is free btw) for removal so that all your leaked content isn't low-hanging fruit made accessible to anyone who knows your name. **Even if you're not someone who \"cares who sees\" or not, you're a business and it DOES NOT benefit you to make your content easily found for free.**\n\nI know everyone's comfort levels are different, and I understand leaks are something that is inherent to this industry. HOWEVER... the idea that taking action to minimize leaks isn't *also* part of your job means you aren't taking your business very seriously, imo. ",

I need this money ASAP this month or I will lose my 3br home to foreclosure and my 2 dogs and I will be living out of my car until god knows when on the streets. My credit is so bad i couldn't even rent a crack house in my own name since I've been unemployed \\~2 yrs now as a software engineer. i have nowhere to go so I'm ready to do whatever it takes to keep a roof over my head. I tried to avoid this as much as possible but have no other options at this point and 0 help from friends/family/external resources whatsoever. streaming NSFW content is my last resort but every platform makes you spend money before making money??? what do I do next???? How can I protect myself from being a complete idiot in my desparation w/o fucking myself over in the future???\n\n**My current emergency plan for this month:**\n\nI planned on doing [Joystick.tv](http://Joystick.tv) bc i'm a gamer and spend 90% of my time on discord streaming in voice chat anyways so this would be easy for me to transition my regular twitch content library of ready-made assets for social media into joystick stream stuff but creating *new* NSFW content w/o violating TOS/community guidelines while making NSFW social posts on IG/tiktok/snapchat/etc social media public affiliate pages and re-routing people to my main joystick TV page has been annoying af bc i keep getting flagged for showing too much skin on every fucking platform; at this point i've been suspended/account banned 3x on social media and I have no clue when it comes to desigining my tips page for pricing my daily/weekly stream $$$ goals or the best ways to forward my new fans to my paypal business site for the fastest payout possible (same day) w/o having to be locked behind 30 day paywalls or affiliate marketing bullshit pyramid schemes/subscription plans to be a \"top streamer\" before i can cash out.\n\n**Privacy concerns streaming NSFW &amp; How to avoid having my irl identity feat. camgirl content leaked**\n\nI've also been doxxed before just doing SFW streaming on twitch/epal and it's gotten me blacklisted for my irl job as a game software engineer, so I'm terrified of the same happening again if I don't do this correctly by rushing into a random camgirl site and having my nudes leaked to another doxxer or someone being able to reverse img search my NSFW content out of context. So far I haven't done any full nude streams or masturbated on cam but I imagine for most of these places it's to be expected if not par for the course, so someone w/malicious intentions may repurpose that to blackmail me or simply humilate me publicly in my personal life (it's happened before many times; trying to be more careful this time!)\n\nStream sites I have already tried:\n\n* BigO (SFW)\n* Twitch (SFW)\n* EPAL (SFW/NSFW but private 1:1 calls 0 moderation except to punish you and block you from getting paid)\n* [Joystick.tv](http://Joystick.tv)\n\nEveryone keeps saying just make an OF but setting up an OF seems like a very overwhelming waste of time with big gaps for lack of privacy in a highly oversaturated market for new streamers/cam models to get cash fast.\n\nI also checked out feetfinder/sniffr/feetify for selling feet pics/used undies but those have paywalls for subscriptions. why does everything cost so much money before even making a red fucking cent????? ridiculous imo.\n\nHow can I get some kind of live mods/stream bots to help me stay safe before/during/after going live?\n\nI've found an endless amount of stream bots/VPN sites that claim they give you anon privacy online to block bad actors but I figured it's wiser to just ask the camgirl community what they're using before wasting even more time installing/configuring things that don't work and may pose even more security risks down the road if they're not managed/updated properly. Ideally I'd want a human being but can't afford to pay someone and don't have a \"manager\" of any kind to keep the riff raff at bay that I would trust to watch me do this kind of stuff day to day. Any workarounds are much appreciated!\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading this post! I feel better just by asking/venting to someone who truly understands this POV-- even though i'm 1000% terrified what will happen next. just trying to be prepared if nothing else for the fallout.\n\nThis month has been overwhelming to say the least but navigating all of these things blind has been a huge waste of time meanwhile i have $3.22 to show for my efforts.\n\nAll suggestions are very welcome thank you for being kind enough to read my SOS in manic panic mode. out of options/ideas and don't want to be homeless next month.\n\n\n**EDIT**\nThank you so much everyone for your replies this helps tremendously! For context I've had my mortgage extended 2ce in the past 2yrs already so they won't grant me another extension but having these suggestions help more than anything else. Also, I don't have anything against doing NSFW content and don't shame anyone who ever would do it-- it's just been difficult giving up my own career while I transition into this. I hope anyone I may have offended by saying so doesn't mistake me being clear about this-- i think it's a very tough industry and takes immense mental fortitude to be able to do that job on a daily basis and for myself i'm working on recovering my mental health. Thanks though, ya'll take care &lt;3",

    "subtitle": "A guy showed up initially acting as if he already had talked to me before in my cam room on SC. He seemed nice and tipped well. He was very \"normal\" as in just talking and not demanding things, saying he would rather pay me directly to avoid the cut from me in cashapp. I ignored that / said only on site, he was real easy going and fine with it. He would get a bundle of tokens and spend them on me saying he would just give them to me and being like a findom behavior.\n\nThen the next night he had no tokens and was like sorry, but not demanding stuff, just talking saying how he would def have more but wasn't paid. Then he got some bonus tokens the next day, kept talking more like he knew me. I just paid attention to him as he tipped and minor responses / canned. He seemed to get more into saying how our relationship was special. He paid enough tokens but also started sort of trying to tell others to tip who were not. He was right but I was like, please be nice to him in PM and be more gentle.\n\nHe behaved for 2-4 days but then when he got drunk on Friday he started saying how he loved me and really loved me and he could see i had feelings for him etc.. Which I just liked him being a gentleman + was like I am to every guy to him too. He let me go into pvt's etc with other guys, didn't seem jealous. Yet last session he then told me some terrible background stuff about him, basic baggage that is heavy but i don't care.  But then he mentioned being in prison for murder of a \"child molestor\" which I am mortified now since even if they were a child molester um killing someone is crazy to me. Not someone I want to be involved with me. Something I do not want to know about him, TMI.\n\nI wouldn't really care about the ex con thing other than rather not be told / if the customer were normal and came/went/left w/out being so attached. It is the falling in love and being very pushy about not backing down on it.  At first it was GFE fantasy like other customers but he seems to have done the \"slowly creeping up\" more and more into personal feeling into red flag areas. Which combined with the other things is scary since I feel as if I gave him too much attention for a few days and general access to enough images/video that I have available normally to customers to potentially really find me and he seems sort of one to stalk and do image searches aggressively possibly :|  Also he keeps saying more and more things that sound racist suddenly too, side comments that putting them together now feel like he may be in a racist organization :/\n\nFor now I'm staying back minimal interaction and avoided him tonight for now trying to gather my tactics + going through my online checks to make sure i don't have any leaked information (I do this every day almost so I'm paranoid, like finding the separate info even if not doxxing directly which could be conglomerated together to doxx. So I'm really clean / opt'd out of all legal image searches etc).\n\nSo what are guys like this normally like if you ghost / block them? Is this common and they fizzle out move on to the next model, at least in most cases? Feels sort of like he might just do this to models and moves on when they get creeped out. What experiences have others had with this sort of customer and how do you best back out when you haven't given him personal information but he might be one to really try to doxx you? I more want some comfort / help since I feel like I walked into a trap here and now have learned a bit about not doing GFE without really making sure they know it is virtual fake GFE not real GF :/ That seems to be my main mistake. Plus vetting if a findom like guy is really a good one or like this where it is not just no-strings-attached :(\n\n  \nUpdate: I took the commenters advice and went more cold on him, then when he got emotional \"i miss you\" I sent a stern message stating to not get attached to me and I am not his girlfriend in real life, we are in a business transaction only, I'm not a girlfriend i'm his slut he comes to to get away from his girlfriend etc etc.... He responded saying sorry and he wouldn't cross the line again. Of course I will see, but I feel much better and perhaps he is savable, I will have to see....",

It's a good time right now because my OF is dead at the moment, and I feel like I have more fans with my faceless brand that could be directed at these platforms.\n\nI am wondering if any of you have made this shift and if so...how did you do it with the accounts where you were showing your face?

    "subtitle": "Recently there was a post here asking how to deal with leaks. Reading through the many, many replies on that post, I was extremely shocked by the entirely unanimous response being to shrug it off, never ever think about it, or even to consider it \"free advertising.\" 🤮  \n\nI wanted to create my own post to share my point of view for further discussion, as I did not realize how contrary my thoughts on this topic seem to be to the majority of this community. Here are my thoughts:\n\n***Not enough of you seem to take leaks seriously or consider them a breach of your privacy as well as a threat to your business.*** No, leaks are not \"free advertising\" - if someone is searching out of their way for your leaked content they already know who you are AND have zero reason to pay you for your work because you're doing nothing to minimize the amount of your work that can be found elsewhere for free. There are places it is beneficial for you to be advertised, however the demographic of leak sites is NOT the demographic you want to be advertising to. It's like going into a shoplifting forum and promoting your store. Think about it, how does that really benefit you? \n\nYes leaks are inevitable, yes there are certain kinds of customers who are going to find your leaked content no matter what you do. However, there are genuinely so many actions you can easily take to make it more inconvenient for people to find your leaked content, therefore creating a situation where if someone wants to see something from you they will HAVE to pay for it. Many of these sites ARE dmca compliant and will remove content if you contact them with a valid request. You should know which sites are possible to remove from and check up on those regularly, getting content taken down ASAP when possible to do so is very important for preventing further distribution to more takedown-resilient hosts. And if a site doesn't comply with DMCA, at least send a Google request and make sure people can't just easily find things on Google. \n\nIt's like owning a bike shop and having bikes sitting out front on display. Do you want to have a lock on those bikes or not? OF COURSE YOU DO. At a bare minimum, you should be submitting links to Google (which is free btw) for removal so that all your leaked content isn't low-hanging fruit made accessible to anyone who knows your name. **Even if you're not someone who \"cares who sees\" or not, you're a business and it DOES NOT benefit you to make your content easily found for free.**\n\nI know everyone's comfort levels are different, and I understand leaks are something that is inherent to this industry. HOWEVER... the idea that taking action to minimize leaks isn't *also* part of your job means you aren't taking your business very seriously, imo. ",

This is my first post in this sub, but I have been reading so much on here about NF and just want to give a really heartfelt THANK YOU &lt;3 to all the femmes/people who contribute to these threads and subsequently make it easier for us newbs to navigate this exciting/overwhelming process. It's very helpful, and I look forward to paying it forward in the future.\n\nOkay, that said, there is lots to learn when setting up your persona/brand and the (extensive) rules and designing your template/aesthetic. I see there is obviously a big no no on copyrighted or trademarked material... but I want my angle to be more nerdy/sci-fi as I am a giant nerd and feel it would bring me a lot of joy to my work to do a lot of eccentric role plays and weird costuming and so on.  \n\nThough there is endless p\\*rn out there with known trademarked characters, I'm worried about where the lines might be around utilizing fictional character lore on a NF profile. Originally my name was a twist on a famous Marvel character, I toned it down a bit, so it's less overt. Will any sort of costumes that imitate a known character be flagged/banned? Obv they can trace it back to you and you are profiting off use, so I'm thinking to try to keep all visuals and references fairly vague, make up some of my own characters, but can get more specific or detailed in conversations/role plays if callers want... because that's not like recorded or anything, and I don't think you can get sued for just pretending, but I just don't really get when something like a name is okay as a pun/parody/homage, or when it's considered IP theft.\n\nJust wanted to ask if anyone has experience having to skirt this or know how heavily this gets enforced!  I notice there aren't a ton of these zany characters on NF and I'm unsure if that's cause it's dangerous legal territory, not a popular angle, or just not something that Flirts themselves are interested in. TIA! \n\n\n\nTL;DR - how heavily does NF enforce copyright rules on parodies of famous fictional characters (including, name, brand, templates, etc.)?",

It catches synchronous calls that freeze the event loop (like `time.sleep()`, `requests.get()`, or CPU-intensive operations) and provides detailed stack traces showing exactly where the blocking occurs. Zero configuration required - just install and run your tests.\n\n**The problem it solves**\n\nEvent loop blocking is the silent killer of async performance. A single `time.sleep(0.1)` in an async function can tank your entire application's throughput, but these issues hide during development and only surface under production load. Traditional testing can't detect these problems because the tests still pass - they just run slower than they should.\n\n**Target audience**\n\nThis is a pytest-plugin for Python developers building asyncio applications. It's particularly valuable for teams shipping async web services, AI agent frameworks, real-time applications, and concurrent data processors where blocking calls can destroy performance under load but are impossible to catch reliably during development.\n\n        pip install pytest-pyleak\n        \n        import pytest\n        \n        @pytest.mark.no_leak\n        async def test_my_application():\n            ...\n\n**PyPI**: `pip install pyleak`\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak](https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak)",

It's particularly valuable for teams working on high-throughput async services (web APIs, websocket servers, data processing pipelines) where small leaks compound into major performance issues under load.\n\n**The Problem It Solves**\n\nIn concurrent async code, it's surprisingly easy to create tasks without awaiting them, or accidentally block the event loop with synchronous calls. These issues often don't surface until you're under load, making them hard to debug in production.\n\nInspired by Go's [goleak](https://github.com/uber-go/goleak) package, adapted for Python's async patterns.\n\n\n\n**PyPI**: `pip install pyleak`\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak](https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak)",

    "subtitle": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm excited to share a project I've been working on: Resk-LLM, a Python library designed to enhance the security of applications based on Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and others.\n\n## What My Project Does\nResk-LLM focuses on adding a protective layer to LLM interactions, helping developers experiment with strategies to mitigate risks like prompt injection, data leaks, and content moderation challenges.\n\n🔗 GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Resk-Security/Resk-LLM\n\n## Motivation\nAs LLMs become more integrated into apps, security challenges like prompt injection, data leakage, and manipulation attacks have become serious concerns.\nHowever, many developers lack accessible tools to experiment with LLM security mechanisms easily.\n\nWhile some solutions exist, they are often closed-source, narrowly scoped, or too tied to a single provider.\n\nI built Resk-LLM to make it easier for developers to prototype, test, and understand LLM vulnerabilities and defenses — with a focus on transparency, flexibility, and multi-provider support.\n\nThe project is still experimental and intended for learning and prototyping, not production-grade security yet — but I'm excited to open it up for feedback and contributions.\n\n## Target Audience\nResk-LLM is aimed at:\n\nDevelopers building LLM-based applications who want to explore basic security protections.\n\nSecurity researchers interested in LLM attack surface exploration.\n\nHobbyists or students learning about the security challenges of generative AI systems.\n\nWhether you're experimenting locally, building internal tools, or simply curious about AI safety, Resk-LLM offers a lightweight, flexible framework to prototype defenses.\n\n⚠️ Important Note:\nResk-LLM is not audited by third-party security professionals. It is experimental and should not be trusted to secure sensitive production workloads without extensive review.\n\n## Comparison\nCompared to other available security tools for LLMs:\n\nGuardrails.ai and similar frameworks mainly focus on output filtering.\n\nSome platform-specific defenses (like OpenAI Moderation API) are vendor locked.\n\nResearch libraries often address single vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection only).\n\nResk-LLM tries to be modular, provider-agnostic, and multi-dimensional, addressing different attack surfaces at once:\n\nPrompt injection protection (pattern matching, semantic similarity)\n\nPII and doxxing detection\n\nContent moderation with customizable rules\n\nContext management to avoid unintentional leakage\n\nMalicious URL and IP leak detection\n\nCanary token insertion to monitor for data leaks\n\nAnd more (full features in the README)\n\nAdditionally, Resk-LLM allows custom security rule ingestion via flexible regex patterns or embeddings, letting users tailor defenses based on their own threat models.\n\n## Key Features\n🛡️ Prompt Injection Protection\n\n🔒 Input Sanitization\n\n📊 Content Moderation\n\n🧠 Customizable Security Patterns\n\n🔍 PII and Doxxing Detection\n\n🧪 Deployment and Heuristic Testing Tools\n\n🕵️ Pre-filtering malicious prompts with vector-based similarity\n\n📚 Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, DeepSeek, OpenRouter APIs\n\n🚨 Canary Token Leak Detection\n\n🌐 IP and URL leak prevention\n\n📋 Pattern Ingestion for Flexible Security Rules\n\nDocumentation &amp; Source Code\nThe full installation guide, usage instructions, and example setups are available on the GitHub repository. Contributions, feature requests, and discussions are very welcome! 🚀\n\n🔗 GitHub Repository - Resk-LLM\n\nConclusion\nI hope this post gives you a good overview of what Resk-LLM is aiming for.\nI'm looking forward to feedback, new ideas, and collaborations to push this project forward.\n\nIf you try it out or have thoughts on additional security layers that could be explored, please feel free to leave a comment — I'd love to hear from you!\n\nHappy experimenting and stay safe! 🛡️",

    "subtitle": "Been doing backend Python for ~5 years now, and I finally got fed up enough with the state of event handling to build something. Sharing it here in case anyone else is fighting the same battles.\n\nLook, we've all built our own event systems. Observer patterns, pubsub, custom dispatchers, you name it. I must have written the same boilerplate in a dozen codebases:\n\n```python\ndef subscribe(self, event, callback):\n  self._subscribers[event].append(callback)\n  \ndef unsubscribe(self, event, callback):\n  self._subscribers[event].remove(callback)\n  # Inevitably miss an edge case and cause a memory leak\n```\n\nIt's fine. It works. Until it doesn't.\n\nAfter spending time with React and Angular on some frontend projects, I kept thinking \"why is this still so damn manual in my Python code?\" Debugging race conditions and update loops was driving me crazy.\n\nSo I made [`reaktiv`](https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv) - basically bringing reactive signals to Python with proper asyncio support.\n\nHere's what it looks like:\n\n```python\nfrom reaktiv import Signal, ComputeSignal, Effect\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def main():\n    # This is our source of truth\n    counter = Signal(0)\n    \n    # This updates automatically when counter changes\n    doubled = ComputeSignal(lambda: counter.get() * 2)\n    \n    # This runs whenever dependencies change\n    async def log_state():\n        # Automatic dependency tracking\n        print(f\"Counter: {counter.get()}, Doubled: {doubled.get()}\")\n    \n    # Need to keep reference or it'll get garbage collected\n    logger = Effect(log_state)\n    logger.schedule()\n    \n    # Change a value, everything just updates\n    counter.set(5)\n    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Give it a tick\n    \nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nNo dependencies. Works with asyncio out of the box.\n\nWhat this solved for me:\n- No more manually wiring up observers to 5 different publishers\n- No more broken unsubscribe logic causing memory leaks (been there)\n- When data changes, computed values update automatically - just like React/Angular but server-side\n- Plays nice with asyncio (finally)\n\nWe've been using it in a dashboard service for the last few months and it's held up surprisingly well. Definitely fewer WTFs per minute than our old homegrown event system.\n\nAnyway, nothing revolutionary, just something I found helpful. On PyPI if anyone wants it.\n\nWhat battle-tested patterns do you all use for complex state management on the backend? Still feel like I'm missing tricks.",

You can add and update rules via an AI agent that asks a few questions, and then defines and tests the rule for you.\n\nFor example, you might add a rule to remove credit card numbers and phones. Then, when your users send:\n\n&gt; Hello, my card number is 4111-1111-1111-1111. Call me at (123) 456-7890\n\nThe proxy will remove the sensitive data and send this instead:\n\n&gt; Hello, my card number is &lt;VISA-CARD&gt;. Call me at &lt;US-NUMBER&gt;\n\n\n**Target Audience**\n\nEngineers using the OpenAI at work that want to prevent sensitive data from leaking.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nThere are several libraries to remove sensitive data from text, however, you still need to do the integration with OpenAI, this project automates adding, and maitaining the rules, and provides a transparent integration with OpenAI. No need to change your existing code.",

    "title": "[Release 0.4.0] TSignal: A Flexible Python Signal/Slot System for Async and Threaded Python—Now with",
    "subtitle": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m thrilled to announce TSignal 0.4.0, a pure-Python signal/slot library that helps you build event-driven applications with ease. TSignal integrates smoothly with async/await, handles thread safety for you, and doesn’t force you to install heavy frameworks.\n\n# What’s New in 0.4.0\n## Weak Reference Support\nYou can now connect a slot with weak=True. If the receiver object is garbage-collected, TSignal automatically removes the connection, preventing memory leaks or stale slots in long-lived applications:\n\n```python\n# Set weak=True for individual connections\nsender.event.connect(receiver, receiver.on_event, weak=True)\n\n# Or, set weak_default=True at class level (default is True)\n@t_with_signals(weak_default=True)\nclass WeakRefSender:\n    @t_signal\n    def event(self):\n        pass\n\n# Now all connections from this sender will use weak references by default\n# No need to specify weak=True for each connect call\nsender = WeakRefSender()\nsender.event.connect(receiver, receiver.on_event)  # Uses weak reference\n\n# Once `receiver` is GC’d, TSignal cleans up automatically.\n```\n\n## One-Shot Connections (Optional)\nA new connection parameter, one_shot=True, lets you disconnect a slot right after its first call. It’s handy for “listen-once” or “single handshake” scenarios. Just set:\n\n```python\nsignal.connect(receiver, receiver.handler, one_shot=True)\n```\n\nThe slot automatically goes away after the first emit.\n\n## Thread-Safety Improvements\nTSignal’s internal locking and scheduling mechanisms have been refined to further reduce race conditions in high-concurrency environments. This ensures more robust behavior under demanding multi-thread loads.\n\n## From Basics to Practical Use Cases\nWe’ve expanded TSignal’s examples to guide you from simple demos to full-fledged applications. Each example has its own GitHub link with fully commented code.\n\nFor detailed explanations, code walkthroughs, and architecture diagrams of these examples, check out our [Examples Documentation](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/docs/examples.md).\n\n### Basic Signal/Slot Examples\n\n- [signal_basic.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/signal_basic.py) and [signal_async.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/signal_async.py)\n  - demonstrate how to define simple synchronous and async slots.\n\n- [signal_function_slots.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/signal_function_slots.py) and [signal_lambda_slots.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/signal_lambda_slots.py)\n  - show how you can connect signals to standalone functions and lambdas.\n\n### Multi-Threading and Workers\n\n- [thread_basic.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/thread_basic.py) and [thread_worker.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/thread_worker.py)\n  - walk you through multi-threaded setups, including background tasks and worker loops.\n  - You’ll see how signals emitted from a background thread are properly handled in the main event loop or another thread’s loop.\n\n### Stock Monitor (Console &amp; GUI)\n\n- [stock_monitor_simple.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/stock_monitor_simple.py)\n  - A minimal stock monitor that periodically updates a display. Perfect for learning how TSignal can orchestrate real-time updates without blocking.\n\n- [stock_monitor_console.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/stock_monitor_console.py)\n  - A CLI-based interface that lets you type commands to set alerts, list them, and watch stock data update in real time.  \n\n- [stock_monitor_ui.py](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python/blob/main/examples/stock_monitor_ui.py)\n  - A more elaborate Kivy-based UI example showcasing real-time stock monitoring. You'll see how TSignal updates the interface instantly without freezing the GUI. This example underscores how TSignal’s thread and event-loop management keeps your UI responsive and your background tasks humming.\n\nTogether, these examples highlight TSignal’s versatility—covering everything from quick demos to production-like patterns with threads, queues, and reactive UI updates.\n\n# Why TSignal?\nPure Python, No Heavy Frameworks\nTSignal imposes no large dependencies; it’s a clean library you can drop into your existing code.\n\n## Async-Ready\nBuilt for modern asyncio workflows; you can define async slots that are invoked without blocking your event loop.\n\n## Thread-Safe by Design\nSignals are dispatched to the correct thread or event loop behind the scenes, so you don’t have to manage locks.\n\n## Flexible Slots\nConnect to class methods, standalone functions, or lambdas. Use strong references (the usual approach) or weak=True.\n\n## Robust Testing &amp; Examples\nWe’ve invested heavily in test coverage, plus we have real-world examples (including a GUI!) to showcase best practices.\n\n### Quick Example\n```python\nfrom tsignal import t_with_signals, t_signal, t_slot\n\n@t_with_signals\nclass Counter:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.count = 0\n\n    @t_signal\n    def count_changed(self):\n        pass\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.count += 1\n        self.count_changed.emit(self.count)\n\n@t_with_signals\nclass Display:\n    @t_slot\n    def on_count_changed(self, value):\n        print(f\"Count is now: {value}\")\n\ncounter = Counter()\ndisplay = Display()\ncounter.count_changed.connect(display, display.on_count_changed)\ncounter.increment()\n# Output: \"Count is now: 1\"\n```\n\n# Get Started\n- GitHub Repo: [TSignal on GitHub](https://github.com/TSignalDev/tsignal-python)\n- Documentation &amp; Examples: Explore how to define your own signals and slots, integrate with threads, or build a reactive UI.\n- Issues &amp; PRs: We welcome feedback, bug reports, and contributions.\n\nIf you’re building async or threaded Python apps that could benefit from a robust event-driven approach, give TSignal a try. We’d love to know what you think—open an issue or share your experience!\n\n**Thanks for checking out TSignal 0.4.0**, and happy coding!",

Check [here](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv) or [here](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage) to compare yourself.\n- Truly FOSS (no freemium, no paid plans, no tokens) when compared to commercial offerings like [`snyk`](https://snyk.io/) or [`jit.io`](https://www.jit.io/). Additionally Python-centric and sticks with tools widely known by developers (their own environment and GitHub interface).\n\n&gt; See detailed comparison in the documentation here: https://open-nudge.github.io/opentemplate/latest/template/about/comparison/\n\n## Target audience\n\n- Any Python developer creating Python projects, people looking to have high code development standards, security and quality without spending a lot of time on configuration/creating from scratch.\n- IMO reliable (and also heavily tested, even the pipelines during each PR if changed), hence should be suitable for production use even for mature projects.\n- Could also act as a base for other templates, as there is a quite extensive description of features and how to adjust them\n\n## Quick start\n\nInstallation and usage on GitHub here: https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start or in the documentation: https://open-nudge.github.io/opentemplate/latest/#quick-start\n\n## Usage scenarios/examples\n\nExpand the example on GitHub here: https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate?tab=readme-ov-file#examples\n\n## Check it out!\n\n- GitHub repository: https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate\n- GitHub discussions: https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate/discussions\n- GitHub issues: [issues](https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate/issues)\n- Full documentation: https://open-nudge.github.io/opentemplate/latest/template/\n- FAQ: https://open-nudge.github.io/opentemplate/latest/template/about/faq/\n\nThanks in advance, feedback, questions, ideas, following are all appreciated, hope you find it useful and interesting!\n",

    "relevance": false,
    "title": "Show r/Python: SpytoRec - My Python CLI to Record &amp; Organize Spotify Streams (Spotipy, FFmpeg, Rich)",
    "subtitle": "Hey Pythonistas!\n\nI'm excited to share a personal project I've been developing called **SpytoRec**! I've put a lot of effort into making it a robust and user-friendly tool, and I'd love to get your feedback.\n\n**GitHub Repo:**[https://github.com/Danidukiyu/SpytoRec](https://github.com/Danidukiyu/SpytoRec)\n\n  \n**1. What My Project Does**\n\nSpytoRec is a Python command-line tool I developed to record audio streams from Spotify for *personal use*. It essentially listens to what you're currently playing on Spotify via a virtual audio cable setup. Key functionalities include:\n\n* **Recording:** Captures the audio stream using FFmpeg.\n* **Automatic Track Splitting:** Intelligently splits the recording into individual song files by detecting actual track changes reported by the Spotify API.\n* **Metadata Embedding:** Fetches rich metadata (title, artist, album, cover art for FLAC) from Spotify and embeds it into the recorded files using `mutagen`.\n* **Audio File Integrity:** Includes a step to rewrite audio file headers, which helps ensure correct duration display and compatibility in various music players.\n* **File Organization:** Optionally organizes the recorded tracks into an `Artist/Album/TrackName.format` directory structure.\n* **User Configuration:** Uses a `config.ini` file for persistent settings (like API keys, default format, output directory) and offers an interactive setup for API keys if they're missing.\n\n**2. Target Audience**\n\nThis script is primarily aimed at:\n\n* **Python Enthusiasts &amp; Developers:** Those interested in CLI application development, working with external APIs (like Spotify's), managing external processes (FFmpeg), asynchronous programming with `threading`, and audio metadata manipulation. It's a good example of integrating several libraries to build a practical tool.\n* **Users Wanting Automated Personal Recordings:** Individuals who would like a more automated and organized way to create personal recordings of their Spotify music streams for offline listening or library management.\n* **CLI Power Users:** People who are comfortable using command-line tools and performing an initial setup (which involves configuring audio routing and API keys – though the script now guides through API key setup).\n* **Hobbyists &amp; Tinkerers:** It started as my personal project to solve a need and has grown. While I use it regularly and have tried to make it robust, it's best considered a \"hobbyist/power-user\" tool rather than a commercial, shrink-wrapped product. It's great for those who like to see how things work under the hood.\n\n**3. How SpytoRec Compares to Alternatives**\n\nWhile various methods exist to capture audio, SpytoRec offers a specific set of features and approaches:\n\n* **Open &amp; Transparent (Python):** Being an open-source Python script, its full workings are visible. Users can understand what it's doing and customize it if they have Python knowledge. This contrasts with some closed-source or obfuscated tools.\n* **API-Driven Splitting for Accuracy:** Unlike generic audio recorders that require manual splitting or silence detection (which can be unreliable for gapless albums or varied audio content), SpytoRec uses Spotify's API signals for track changes. This aims for more precise splitting aligned with Spotify's own track boundaries, assuming clean playback.\n* **CLI-Focused Automation:** It's built for users who prefer the command line for its control, scriptability, and automation potential, as opposed to GUI-based applications.\n* **Asynchronous Finalization for Responsiveness:** A key technical differentiator is its use of a background worker thread for time-consuming finalization tasks (FFmpeg processing, cover downloads, tagging). This allows the main recording loop to immediately prepare for the next track, significantly reducing missed audio between consecutive songs – an improvement over simpler, blocking recorders.\n* **Emphasis on Configuration &amp; Control:** The `config.ini` for defaults, interactive API key setup, and detailed command-line arguments (with subparcommands like `list-devices` and `test-auth`) give users good control over the setup and recording process.\n* **Focus on Recording the Audio Stream:** SpytoRec records the audio output stream as it's played (similar to traditional audio recording methods), rather than attempting to download encrypted files directly from Spotify servers, which can have different legal implications and technical challenges.\n\n**Key Python Libraries &amp; Features Used:**\n\n* `Spotipy` for all interactions with the Spotify Web API.\n* `subprocess` to control `FFmpeg` for audio recording and the header rewrite pass.\n* `rich` for a significantly improved CLI experience (panels, live status updates, styled text, tables).\n* `argparse` with subparsers for a structured command system.\n* `configparser` for `config.ini` management.\n* `threading` and `queue` for the asynchronous finalization of recordings.\n* `mutagen` for embedding metadata into audio files.\n* `pathlib` for modern path manipulation.\n\n**What I Learned / Challenges:**\n\nBuilding SpytoRec has been a great learning curve, especially in areas like:\n\n* Reliably controlling and interacting with external FFmpeg processes (including graceful shutdown).\n* Designing a responsive CLI that handles background tasks without freezing.\n* Managing API polling efficiently.\n* Making the initial setup (API keys, audio device configuration) as smooth as possible for end-users of a CLI tool.\n\nI'd be thrilled for you to check out the repository, try out SpytoRec if it sounds like something you'd find useful for your personal audio library, and I'm very open to any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions!\n\n**Disclaimer:** SpytoRec is intended for personal, private use only. Please ensure your use of this tool complies with Spotify's Terms of Service and all applicable copyright laws in your country.\n\nThanks for taking a look! u/FondantConscious2868",

These contain useful information for answering the above questions and more.\n\n    html_style: list[str]\n\nA list of html tags that will be applied to the paragraph if html=True.\n\n    style: str\n\nThe MS Word paragraph style (e.g., Heading 2, Subtitle, Subtle Emphasis), if any. This will facilitate finding headings, etc.\n\n    lineage: (\"document\", str | None, str | None, str | None, str | None)\n\nDocx2Python partially flattens the xml spaghetti so that a paragraph is always at depth 4. This often means building structure where none exists, so the lineage ...\n\n\\[ostensibly `(great-great-grandparent, great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, self)`\\]\n\n... is not always straightforward. But there are some patterns you can depend on. The most requested is that paragraphs in table cells will always have a lineage of ...\n\n`(\"document\", \"tbl\", something, something, \"p\")`.\n\nUse `iter_tables` and `is_tbl` from the `docx2python.iterators` module to find tables in your document. There is an example in `tests/test_tables_to_markdown.py`.\n\n    runs: list[Run]\n\nA list of Run instances. Each Run instance has and `html_style` and `text` attribute. This will facilitate finding and extracting text with specific formatting.\n\n    run_strings: list[str]\n\nThe extracted text from each text run in a paragraph. `\"\".join(par.text_runs)` will give the complete extracted paragraph text.\n\n    list_position: tuple[str | None, list[int]]\n\nThe address of a paragraph in a nested list. The first item in the tuple is a string identifier for the list. These are extracted from Word, and may look like indices, but they are not. List \"2\" might come before list \"1\" in the document. The second item is a list of indices to show where you are in that list.\n\n    1. paragraph  # list_position = (\"list_id\", [0])\n    2. paragraph  # list_position = (\"list_id\", [1])\n       a. paragraph  # list_position = (\"list_id\", [1, 0])\n          i. paragraph  # list_position = (\"list_id\", [1, 0, 0])\n       b. paragraph  # list_position = (\"list_id\", [1, 1])\n    3. paragraph  # list_position = (\"list_id\", [2])\n\n# Example\n\nTo iterate through `Par` instances extracted from a `*.docx` file:\n\n    from docx2python import docx2python\n    from docx2python.iterators import iter_paragraphs\n    \n    with docx2python(\"file.docx\") as docx:\n        pars = docx.document_pars  # -&gt; [[[[Par]]]]\n    \n    for par in iter_paragraphs(pars):\n        # format your tables as markdown, search for headings,\n        # identify outline position, find formatted text, etc.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nProfessionals and amateurs wishing to scan, reformat, or store information from Microsoft Word documents.\n\n# Comparison\n\nThe code began in 2019 as an expansion/contraction of python-docx2txt (Copyright (c) 2015 Ankush Shah). The original code is mostly gone, but some of the bones may still be here.\n\nshared features:\n\n* extracts text from docx files\n* extracts images from docx files\n\nadditions:\n\n* extracts footnotes and endnotes\n* converts bullets and numbered lists to ascii with indentation\n* converts hyperlinks to &lt;a href=\"http:/...\"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;\n* retains some structure of the original file (more below)\n* extracts document properties (creator, lastModifiedBy, etc.)\n* inserts image placeholders in text ('----image1.jpg----')\n* inserts plain text footnote and endnote references in text ('----footnote1----')\n* (optionally) retains font size, font color, bold, italics, and underscore as html\n* extracts math equations\n* extracts user selections from checkboxes and dropdown menus\n* extracts comments\n* extracts some paragraph properties (e.g., Heading 1)\n* tracks location within numbered lists\n\nsubtractions:\n\n* no command-line interface\n* will only work with Python 3.8+",

    "subtitle": "[YT Channel Downloader](https://github.com/hyperfield/yt-channel-downloader/) is a cross-platform open source desktop application built to simplify the process of downloading YouTube content. It utilizes [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [scrapetube](https://github.com/dermasmid/scrapetube), and [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube) under the hood, paired with an easy-to-use graphical interface. This tool aims to offer you a seamless experience to get your favorite video and audio content offline. You can selectively or fully download channels, playlists, or individual videos, opt for audio-only tracks, and customize the quality of your video or audio. More improvements are on the way!\n\nTarget audience: anyone who wants to save a video or an audio for later (e.g. for use in an offline situation).\n\nThis app is different from similar apps in the sense that it allows to get not just single videos, but selectively or fully get an entire channel or playlist, and customize the audio/video quality to one's liking with an easy GUI.\n\n[https://github.com/hyperfield/yt-channel-downloader](https://github.com/hyperfield/yt-channel-downloader)  \nThe Windows installer is available in the Releases section. For Linux and macOS users, please refer to the installation instructions in the README.\n\nSuggestions for new features, bug reports, and ideas for improvements are welcome :)\n\n\nPlease note that one should not download videos for any other purpose than personal (for example, for watching a video while on a trip with limited or non-existent internet connectivity) to avoid any copyright issues. Also, downloading videos from Youtube is not in accord with Youtube's Terms of Service, which has been a widely discussed controversial issue (see, for example, [this](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/07/13/is-it-legal-to-download-youtube-videos/)). So, if you have agreed to Youtube ToS, you might go against it by downloading a video, even if it's your own video!",
