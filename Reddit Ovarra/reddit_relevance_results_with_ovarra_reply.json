        "body": "I feel there needs to be an invite only way to discuss this, I think a lot of people will feel guilty upvoting this because you've provided a lot of resources for people to find our stolen content, and reddit is highly prioritized by google.\n\nI think the fronts we can realistically fight them are billing and data warehousing. To a lesser degree DMCA complaints to google will remove specific results from specific domains, but thyis is a lot more whack-a-mole. They can roll out new domains with a dozen mouse clicks or less, most likely - domains cost like 10 dollars, then all the takedown work has to be done again.\n\n\\## Billing:\n\nI believe the way to stop them is through billing. Find who their visa/mastercard/amex transactions are billing through and file complaints with the issuing aquirers, banks and VISA/MC itself.\n\nIn reviewing the last 3 by (trying test signups) I found that at least from my location in South America, their visa/mastercard billing seems to be down - I dont have a good VPN right now to test from other locations, no doubt someone in North America would get a different result.\n\nIn the past my investigations led me to find they were passing themselves off to billlers as a hosting company, and memberships as hosting packages which allows them to bypass high risk fees and registration as well as audits and compliance checks that any other adult site would have to submit to.\n\nThey can still use crypto, but that is a very small community. If we can get and keep them busted down to crypto only, their massive data hosting and bandwidth bills will likely be unmanageable.\n\n\\## Data Hosting:\n\nThe other front is data hosting, they are hosting a massive amount of data. I have been recording my own shows in paralell with them for 5 years and I produce about 10TB of data per year in video storage, multiply that by every performer out there and you got an astronomical amount of data that most likely only Amazon, Google or MS could store.\n\nI dont think any of them would continue to host the data if they were publicly made aware of its nature and the overwhelming lack of performer consent.\n\n\\## Conclusion:\n\nTakedowns are a slap on the wrist, easy to come back from.\n\nGetting their billing pulled is a massive financial blow, - they will most likely recover, but ouch.\n\nGetting their AWS accounts terminated would mean they lose all existing data and have to start recording again from scratch. - this would be the real solution.",

So it probably not an insane amount of data if theyre just storing maybe 1MB per video. And I definitely do agree I think there would be utility in a better way to discuss. \n\nI'm sorry if my post comes off a bit spammy, its just frustrating to try to hop between a few dozen different threads from the past few years to keep track of what other people have figured out, and whats still up to date/realvent.

I totally get your hesitation — giving your real name for DMCA takedowns *feels* scary at first, but it’s actually normal and legally required since you're asserting ownership over the content. I’ve done it myself through services like **Rulta** (they handle it on your behalf, so your name isn't exposed to the sites directly), and I’ve also filed a few manually when I had to.\n\nWith sites like the ones you linked, yes, it’s possible to get stuff removed, *but* be aware:\n\n1. You’re likely submitting your info to a blackhole and hoping they honor the DMCA\n2. Some shady sites ignore takedowns unless they’re followed up legally\n\nIf you're nervous about privacy, I highly recommend using a **DMCA agency or third party** like Rulta. They include the legal info on your behalf and shield your real name from being publicly visible. It worked for me, especially with Recurbate, which I thought was impossible.\n\nSo yes — it *can* work, and yes, it’s safe if done properly. You're not alone in this 💪 If you want help wording a DMCA or exploring services, happy to share more."

But if privacy is a concern (which it often is in this space), some people use a trusted rep or agency to handle it on their behalf. Also, some sites will comply faster than others, especially if they’re based outside the US. Just keep documenting what you submit and follow up when needed."

They took care of them right away what was great. They scan for it every day and I get daily reports and if I find something I can report it manually and they handle it! Even fake social media profiles what is great!!!\n\nSo I can highly recommend them, it made me way more relaxed about my work, now that I do not have to worry so much anymore!"

They file DMCAs, track reuploads, and work continuously, which is something I never had the time or mental energy to do on my own. It's not perfect — nothing ever is with this fight — but they’ve gotten a ton of my stolen content removed from places I thought were untouchable.\n\nI’m curious too if anyone here has done it through **Chaturbate support directly**?

As I’ve mentioned before, which got overlooked, It would be a ridiculously full time unpaid job to do this ourselves. There ARE pros and cons to having our videos leaked. However, if it bothers the individual that much, she should not have become a cam model because it’s part of the job.

If someone wants to consider leaks free advertisement, fine. If someone doesn't care because at the end of the day they're still making their money, fine. If someone wants resources to remove as much content as possible, fine. Like people have different experiences, perspectives, and business decisions about their business.

Your labor protections are never something you’re going to be paid for. You organize for them, with other workers who are also tired of the conditions you’re both enduring - like piracy. You do not HAVE to pay for content removal - it’s entirely possible to do it yourself and large scale at that. Your income has not increased because of leaks. You may (and it would be hard to measure without the actual metadata) have noticed a traffic increase recently and are falsely conflating that with an income boost. It’s not “free advertising” - it’s literally costing you money. If your paid shows are being pirated it means you did 1 paid show and god knows how many free ones. Or, like you pointed out, OTHER companies are profiting off of your leaks - not you. \n\nYou are defending leaks and piracy. You are defending stolen content and claiming it benefits you. If it did, a dollar would enter your account every time it happened. That doesn’t happen though. And it never will. Because you will never benefit from someone stealing your intellectual property and reselling it for their own gain.\n\nThis is a constant in this sub - you are literally complaining about the same thing OP is. You are literally sharing in OP’s concerns about the cost of piracy and that it’s detrimental to sex workers (costly, time consuming, etc.) And you STILL circled back to excusing the problem, accepting defeat, tossing your hands in the air, and blaming OP for bringing it up or wording it “poorly” ? (This post is honestly one of the mildest I’ve seen in terms of critique). THAT’S why conditions are only worsening for sex workers and especially in the U.S. \n\nThey’re not “wrong in a way” they’re ON YOUR SIDE! They want YOU and YOUR content protected and YOUR pockets fuller! YOU don’t want to do anything about it! If this attitude continues I fear the U.S. government WILL criminalize sex work in the upcoming years and I wouldn’t be surprised if a considerable amount of you thanked them for it and started commenting about how much it actually “helps” you.

I've even seen dudes argue that girls who post simple selfies online (not even doing OF at all) deserve to have deepfakes made of them, simply because they shared it on the internet so people can do whatever they want with it.

In the case of Recurbate, my DMCA companies were just sending emails not using the submission forum within the site, so it wasn't being removed because they weren't doing it the way the site accepts requests. The second I did it the way the website wants it done the content was gone. DMCA companies are just google cleaners, they don't care if your content gets removed or not and won't check to see if there's a stated removal process for a given site. They just want to put a big number up in your dashboard portal saying they've removed a million things and pat themselves on the back for a fake number when all they did was delist which is helpful but truly not enough.",

Problem is, the photographer owned the copyright so Axel was not successful, and it became public knowledge, and hence from it came a bunch of memes making fun of him ( and to be honest a lot of them were incredibly funny). So the best action in my mind is if nobody is noticing it, don't talk about it, don't request a dmca, and go off the faith that nobody probably will notice it. \n\nAnd there's always a chance these websites will be taken down in the future and your footprint erased, and also remember too there's so much new stuff coming out buy new performers you'll also get buried eventually."

You’re already ahead by using BranditScan and doing DMCAs early, especially since your stuff wasn’t super widespread.

Google just wants *something* to show — so feed it noise. This doesn't happen in a day, or with a handful of images, it takes a lot of work to upload across Reddit, Tumblr, Youtube and other SFW platforms that index, but it will work eventually if you keep to uploading little by little every week. \n\nUse terms like \"username leaks\" \"username cams\" and other terms on these \"noise\" images so you index well on NSFW search terms."

        "body": "This is one of the reasons why I left CB. \n\nI am not worried about my anonymity but, it felt bad to have it all recorded and posted. Especially on slow days, I felt like a monkey at a zoo, everybody just staring at me with no autonomy over my own image.\n\nIf you have the time, you can take the individual url of each video posted and send them all to CB support. They will submit the dmca requests for you. I personally prefer this to branditscan or other paid content removal sites because it forces the platform to do the legwork as opposed to paying out of your own pocket for it. I think in a small way it holds them accountable for the issue and the only way this could ever be solved is with the type of money, power, and developers that these platforms have coming up with a creative solution. If everyone that worked there sent in every url, the platform would have to spend a lot of time putting through those requests and just *maybe* it could incentivize them to try and change it. This is just my own crackpot theory though.\n\nAlso, in my opinion content removal sites are a scam for the majority of people that use them. I think it's useful only when an individual steals your content and posts to legitimate sites, for example catfish profiles on social media. Content on leak sites doesn't get removed because they don't comply with dmca, the only option is to delist from Google, and since putting the content removal through CB support will also do this, why pay for it? You can also put through delist requests on Google on your own but, this is time consuming and a bit difficult for the average person so I understand why someone wouldn't want to do that. Branditscan promotes itself as \"free\" but this is a lie, they are 45/mo. They also \"estimate\" the amount they are \"saving\" you by \"removing\" your content. It's a huge section of your dashboard when you sign up. But this is incredibly misleading because how do they come up with this imaginary number when they don't know what you typically charge, can't prove that the freeloaders and minors who lurk leak sites could ever actually pay, and the content is not actually gone just harder to find? They can't, it's a bogus claim.\n\n\nAnyways, back to your original concern. A mindset that could help you feel more confident is one I've heard many people share on here. It is that those videos are free promotion. When they watch them, they don't actually get to see you live, they don't get to interact with you, they don't get the image and sound quality you were streaming at. All they get is a busted recording on a sketchy site. The potential that they will want more, and will come find you on your paid sites is there, even if uncommon. If you want to stay on CB, try to reframe it as promotion.",

It's so unbelievably uncomfortable that we all just have to accept this fact in order to do this job. :/// I wish camsites would do something to fight back for us, these \"archive\" sites are making money off stealing from us every single day. \n\nI don't view it as free promotion, because people are on those sites specifically because they aren't paying customers. Also, models drive traffic to those sites, not the other way around. I get you're trying to find a silver lining, but I just don't think there is one unfortunately. I think if models who exit the industry because of this began to express these concerns to CB support and cite it as a reason WHY models stopped streaming, maybe they'd eventually put more effort into stopping it. But that is probably also wishful thinking"

For recu.me/recubate, scroll to the very bottom of their site and use their DMCA link to submit your links and ask to have them taken down. I did this and they had them greyed out within hours. \n\nI self submit to Brandit the day after every stream (sometimes they’re on it before I even submit!) and self submit to recu the day after as well.

        "body": "Now, I give you this advice as a 3 decade sex worker mostly all online.   I do not sugar coat advice, **it is time to chose your hard.**\n\nYou can only be humilated if you are ashamed to do this kind of work.  It is your decision to be ashamed of it &amp; let others have that power over you.  And all those you are afraid of judging you, how many of them are handing you $2300 to save your home?  How many of them are going to give you and your dogs a place to live?\n\nBlackmail is a felony.  But you can reframe being outed as free marketing.\n\nNever heard of any of those sites you mentioned, but I don't game.  And it seems that you at this point can't make money that way.  From my limited knowledge of getting paid to game may take years to build up any kind of income from it.\n\nStreamate would be your best choice, but being found out is about 80%.   And sometimes tough choices need to be made.\n\nYou can choose to do online sex work and own it for a career &amp; be better paid for sexism or continue to work so called normal jobs.    There are so many ways to make money with online sex work than ever.   Best to show your face and really go for it if you want to make that kind of money.  It is all a risk and you might not.\n\nIt is the internet and AI exist so you know all those bots and claims to privacy are just bullshit &amp; all they want is your money for nothing.\n\nYes, the stigma of sex work exist.  And so does the stigma of being homeless, once homeless getting on your feet again will be so much harder. Plus you will be way more vulnerable to predators.\n\nIt is about chosing your hard.  Each path will be hard but if you are going to do sex work then at least go for it in a real way.\n\nCamming is a sales job. And you will need many of the skills you already have to be a success at it. It isn't easy for everyone.  It is a risk, but so is being homeless.\n\nMight be time to hit the local strip club and try to make money on stage as an option.\n\n99% of us do NOT have managers, why would you need one?  You sign up to a legit cam site and get to work.  There are threads on here for newbies, there are blogs and youtube for such information too.   \n\nYou pick a site like Streamate or Chaturbate, you read all their rules &amp; TOS.  Have a cold and hot drink ready, some baby oil and cute simple outfit on, a selfie light, webcam and GO.  You ask men to give you money.    Log on and get to hustling and try to put in 8 to 12 hours a day on cam. \n\n **NEVER go off site.** \n\n**NEVER give out personal information or website**\n\n**NEVER accept paypal, cashapp or venmo they can pay you through the cam site**\n\n**NEVER trust any man to tell you how to make money in this biz.  They all lie and are trying to rip you off.** \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBanks are dealing with lots of foreclosures, so call them up and try to work something out.  And lots of people in tech are losing their jobs.\n\nYou might sell somethings to help come up with the money.  Ask your family, friends and sometimes Churches help people out.  Then go to a food pantry for free food to help tide you over &amp; not be spending money there.",

It is more hassle for them to do this than it is for you to just pay/promise to pay.  Connect with local organizations and churches.  I once was on the verge of getting evicted and had a church give me $450 towards my total needed.   That might not be ALL you need BUT it takes down a significant portion of what you need..  There are options.  You can do this!  If you need to, join a studio temporarily for daily pay.  BoleynModels is decent and they have Streamate, CB, and Strip Chat.  You can easily make $1,000 a week if you absolutely sent it.",

Or, if not 100% removed, at least made very difficult to find!  \n  \nThe best approach is to start by reporting all the pirate websites through DMCA notices. For those that don't comply, you can investigate them further. Once you have gathered enough information, you can escalate by targeting them from different angles such as sending DMCA reports to their hosting provider, CDN, ad network, affiliate partners, etc. If they are based in Europe, you can also consider sending GDPR notices.  \n  \nFinally, you can request that the infringing content be removed and de-indexed from search engines. This way, the only way someone could find the content is by having the exact URL or by manually searching within the pirate site itself (which is highly unlikely), especially for people you know in real life who don’t know your username.\n\nThe process isn’t always quick, as some links may periodically resurface in search results. But if you stick with it over time, you’ll see amazing results :)"

Personally Branditscan is what I'm using now since they are cheapest, don't fall for the scam of overpaying for \"more advanced protection\" because a lot of what's being advertised is fake.

They are somewhat effective in cleaning up Google results, sometimes they can get things removed directly from source but that part is more difficult.\n\nI recommend keeping an eye on the links you're most concerned about and keeping tabs on how effective your DMCA service is. For some websites you might have better success contacting them yourself using an alias and a DMCA notice addressed to the piracy site (if they have a public email address) as well as to their hosting provider, which you can usually find within Whois database.\n\nDepending on how popular your shows were, it's possible that there's no way to get everything removed. Unfortunately there's certain websites that no DMCA service can help you with, which require substantial legal resources to target and still uncertain results which may not be worth the effort required to put up a fight. Not trying to discourage the effort, just trying to be realistic so you know what to expect.

To this day I still find content resurfacing from years ago, but the service definitely handles most of it once it’s set up. You won’t have to fight it alone forever. I’ve heard from a few friends that after being inactive for a while, the leaked content eventually stopped. I think it depends on how big or popular you were at your peak.\n\nAlso, unless your employer is doing some kind of facial recognition background check (which would be weird and super invasive), it’s not something they’re likely to come across. These days there’s so much content out there, and unless someone is specifically looking for *you* (in which case they'd need to explain why), they probably won’t find it by accident.\n\nAs long as you start submitting DMCAs, I really think you’ll be able to breathe a little easier and probably be okay."

It’s measurably detrimental. It literally costs you money. You’ve already admitted to paying for removal services.

So I asked you for specifics on how you made this determination via \"analytics\", because you're making it seem as if you have traffic information showing people finding your page and giving you money after seeing you on a leak site. if all you mean is by personal observation then just say that instead of trying to sound savvy.

Men will argue that if you're sharing something on the internet at all, even if it's to a small audience of paying customers who have consent to view your content, that it's okay to share with a wider audience. It can be so, so, so disheartening to see your intimate content shown to tens of thousands of misogynistic freeloaders you didn't consent to sharing with.\n\nIt definitely is a major violation of consent, but sadly there seems to be no respect for consent on the internet in general. I've even seen dudes argue that girls who post simple selfies online (not even doing OF at all) deserve to have deepfakes made of them, simply because they shared it on the internet so people can do whatever they want with it. It's a scary world we live in where no one has respect for consent or boundaries online.\n\nSome women are more comfortable with leaks it seems, so I was hoping to emphasize the business aspect here, because I personally think it affects everyone when people choose to be passive or even take a positive view that it's \"free advertising\"."

In my experience I've had better luck submitting content myself for removal than using DMCA services. Feel free to reach out in DM if you want names of DMCA compliant sites to check up on.

There is something in there for everyone and you can always do it yourself. I did that before, but the monitoring and dealing with all the sites is exhausting. Moreover it gave me more time to cam while making my content scarce. It’s a W.

By the end of month most of the leaks were gone and by the end of the 2nd month I couldn’t find any links. I was shocked at how they got so many leaks removed so quickly cuz I had been trying to get it done for over 6 months on my own.

I totally get your hesitation — giving your real name for DMCA takedowns *feels* scary at first, but it’s actually normal and legally required since you're asserting ownership over the content. I’ve done it myself through services like **Rulta** (they handle it on your behalf, so your name isn't exposed to the sites directly), and I’ve also filed a few manually when I had to.\n\nWith sites like the ones you linked, yes, it’s possible to get stuff removed, *but* be aware:\n\n1. You’re likely submitting your info to a blackhole and hoping they honor the DMCA\n2. Some shady sites ignore takedowns unless they’re followed up legally\n\nIf you're nervous about privacy, I highly recommend using a **DMCA agency or third party** like Rulta. They include the legal info on your behalf and shield your real name from being publicly visible. It worked for me, especially with Recurbate, which I thought was impossible.\n\nSo yes — it *can* work, and yes, it’s safe if done properly.

But if privacy is a concern (which it often is in this space), some people use a trusted rep or agency to handle it on their behalf. Also, some sites will comply faster than others, especially if they’re based outside the US. Just keep documenting what you submit and follow up when needed."

It had to be the site because it was like clockwork.  80 vids taken down... 2-3 days later all 80 vids up again with new URLs.  One site I went through the process 4 or 5 times before I realized it was pointless.\n\nNot sure if it's an option with Rulta but I'd just ask them to only do the google search results take downs and ignore DMCA take downs to sites.

The latter tab will contain a bunch of reports consisting of links we've removed from Google and Bing. If you click on any Google report, for example, you will be redirected to Lumen Database. This is where Google keeps every removed link under check. For site takedowns, we list each and every link with live updates on the removal process, so no, we aren't hiding anything from you. We're on your side and we want those leaks to be cleared ASAP.\n\nAs for your intention to clear all your leaks within a month: it's unfortunately impossible. There's no DMCA company that can clear everything in a month. With most porn sites, our delist rate is around 98% but there will always be some domains that Google won't touch. Besides, removed links can get re-uploaded or re-spread. We have no means of avoiding this but we have what we call re-crawlers that check this type of leaked content every single day for all our subscribers. The hard truth here is that even with inactive creators, it takes at least a few months to clear the most (not all) of your leaks.  \n\nThose remaining images you mentioned here, have you talked to our support team about it? Our live support is active 16 hours a day every day and you will receive a response within seconds. Why don't you just send those links over to us so we can thoroughly check them?"

Or, if not 100% removed, at least made very difficult to find!  \n  \nThe best approach is to start by reporting all the pirate websites through DMCA notices. For those that don't comply, you can investigate them further. Once you have gathered enough information, you can escalate by targeting them from different angles such as sending DMCA reports to their hosting provider, CDN, ad network, affiliate partners, etc. If they are based in Europe, you can also consider sending GDPR notices.  \n  \nFinally, you can request that the infringing content be removed and de-indexed from search engines. This way, the only way someone could find the content is by having the exact URL or by manually searching within the pirate site itself (which is highly unlikely), especially for people you know in real life who don’t know your username.\n\nThe process isn’t always quick, as some links may periodically resurface in search results.

For some websites you might have better success contacting them yourself using an alias and a DMCA notice addressed to the piracy site (if they have a public email address) as well as to their hosting provider, which you can usually find within Whois database.\n\nDepending on how popular your shows were, it's possible that there's no way to get everything removed. Unfortunately there's certain websites that no DMCA service can help you with, which require substantial legal resources to target and still uncertain results which may not be worth the effort required to put up a fight.

To this day I still find content resurfacing from years ago, but the service definitely handles most of it once it’s set up. You won’t have to fight it alone forever. I’ve heard from a few friends that after being inactive for a while, the leaked content eventually stopped. I think it depends on how big or popular you were at your peak.\n\nAlso, unless your employer is doing some kind of facial recognition background check (which would be weird and super invasive), it’s not something they’re likely to come across. These days there’s so much content out there, and unless someone is specifically looking for *you* (in which case they'd need to explain why), they probably won’t find it by accident.\n\nAs long as you start submitting DMCAs, I really think you’ll be able to breathe a little easier and probably be okay."

But pretty often when I look up my username and click on images that come up, I find photos and videos of myself which are totally unattributed to me."

As I’ve mentioned before, which got overlooked, It would be a ridiculously full time unpaid job to do this ourselves. There ARE pros and cons to having our videos leaked. However, if it bothers the individual that much, she should not have become a cam model because it’s part of the job. I think she misunderstood that we just can’t get wrapped up in this affecting our mental health. Worries are more detrimental than we think. And when we’re streaming?

I've had some success with my sites removing content I requested. Not all, and sometimes it takes multiple attempts or requests take a while to be removed. I never said you don't care, I just added an option that is free. Considering the comments whenever threads like these come up, people express the financial challenges.\n\nPersonally, I don't care much for the back and forth about people's opinions about how others handle their own business. If someone wants to consider leaks free advertisement, fine. If someone doesn't care because at the end of the day they're still making their money, fine. If someone wants resources to remove as much content as possible, fine. Like people have different experiences, perspectives, and business decisions about their business. Anyone wanting to add their their opinions about other people's own handling is just commentary, and honestly, it doesn't matter as long as you're content with yourself and your decisions.\n\nI'm assuming this post is based on responses from another post asking people how they deal with content being out there. I responded with my perspective and experience, since it was asked. Everyone's opinion just doesn't matter, which is why I didn't really respond to this thread outside of adding information related to removals."

Your labor protections are never something you’re going to be paid for. You organize for them, with other workers who are also tired of the conditions you’re both enduring - like piracy. You do not HAVE to pay for content removal - it’s entirely possible to do it yourself and large scale at that. Your income has not increased because of leaks. You may (and it would be hard to measure without the actual metadata) have noticed a traffic increase recently and are falsely conflating that with an income boost. It’s not “free advertising” - it’s literally costing you money. If your paid shows are being pirated it means you did 1 paid show and god knows how many free ones. Or, like you pointed out, OTHER companies are profiting off of your leaks - not you. \n\nYou are defending leaks and piracy. You are defending stolen content and claiming it benefits you. If it did, a dollar would enter your account every time it happened. That doesn’t happen though. And it never will. Because you will never benefit from someone stealing your intellectual property and reselling it for their own gain.\n\nThis is a constant in this sub - you are literally complaining about the same thing OP is. You are literally sharing in OP’s concerns about the cost of piracy and that it’s detrimental to sex workers (costly, time consuming, etc.) And you STILL circled back to excusing the problem, accepting defeat, tossing your hands in the air, and blaming OP for bringing it up or wording it “poorly” ? (This post is honestly one of the mildest I’ve seen in terms of critique). THAT’S why conditions are only worsening for sex workers and especially in the U.S. \n\nThey’re not “wrong in a way” they’re ON YOUR SIDE! They want YOU and YOUR content protected and YOUR pockets fuller! YOU don’t want to do anything about it! If this attitude continues I fear the U.S. government WILL criminalize sex work in the upcoming years and I wouldn’t be surprised if a considerable amount of you thanked them for it and started commenting about how much it actually “helps” you.

I've even seen dudes argue that girls who post simple selfies online (not even doing OF at all) deserve to have deepfakes made of them, simply because they shared it on the internet so people can do whatever they want with it. It's a scary world we live in where no one has respect for consent or boundaries online.\n\nSome women are more comfortable with leaks it seems, so I was hoping to emphasize the business aspect here, because I personally think it affects everyone when people choose to be passive or even take a positive view that it's \"free advertising\"."

If they don't know what to search for.\nI guess maybe face? Idk.  I keep myself to myself and no one really cares about me enough to be googling me. \n\nAlso how many people have ofs ? So many people make content it's just in a different form. \n\nAnd anyone in your life that will judge you for this, isn't someone you need in your life. \n\nI've seen a lot of my videos online, full on going for it face and Everything. When I first saw it I was shocked but now I'm just like what the hell, I get to do all these amazing things with this money I can earn by being hot and sexy. If someone sees it then they are just by the same as you by watching corn or making it\n\nI just don't really care, like I said I keep myself to myself there's no reason for anyone to be trying to actively find me online.

I think it is extremely valid for models to be upset about it and don't get why so many of the replies here are dismissive. Yes it is part of the job, but it is for many the absolute worst part of the job.....\n\nMajor difference in feeling comfortable doing something live in a private show or ticket show for people who paid, VS it being online forever for free on all kinds of gross russian websites and impossible to get down. I try to limit piracy by not doing too much in the public chat. This limits leaks substantially because it means no automatic recorder bots will be able to share it, but you still risk viewers recording and posting it on leak forums. \n\nThat's how I deal practically, emotionally is another thing and basically I had to numb myself to it by looking at all my leaks all the time and reporting the links to my DMCA people. Took years for me to be able to look at all of it and not have it affect me emotionally",

Problem is, the photographer owned the copyright so Axel was not successful, and it became public knowledge, and hence from it came a bunch of memes making fun of him ( and to be honest a lot of them were incredibly funny). So the best action in my mind is if nobody is noticing it, don't talk about it, don't request a dmca, and go off the faith that nobody probably will notice it. \n\nAnd there's always a chance these websites will be taken down in the future and your footprint erased, and also remember too there's so much new stuff coming out buy new performers you'll also get buried eventually."

I check the box on pornhub to be an \"exclusive model\" for them. This means I can't upload to other similar sites like xhamster. For agreeing to be exclusive with pornhub, they do automatic DCMA requests on my behalf. \n\n\nThey take down the videos from other sites without me requesting it.

A lot of camming and clip websites offer dmca takedowns for free, you just have to take time to compile the links and the clip or cam website will issue the legal portions on your behalf. Some models go to the infringing website directly to request things be taken down but very careful because a lot of these forms ask for actual names and addresses. In my opinion, it is best to have a third party do that for safety reasons but it is also an option that is there. I find a lot of websites internationally do not even compy with DMCA laws because it is American. Branditscan is pretty awesome for google search removal at a bare minimum and I’ve used them on and off throughout the years for both dmca content and google removal, but there are other companies, too worth researching.",

If I disable logged out traffic but still allow US customers and don't geoblock, am I able to still get them taken down from Liveviolet in the future? I've been so busy the past few weeks this prob has something to do with that as the video on LV has over 100k views! Insanity! Don't know if I should just appreciate the extra promo lol guess thats one way to look at it.",

So they don't (or don't mean to) use those highly secured accounts for promotions/ads",
